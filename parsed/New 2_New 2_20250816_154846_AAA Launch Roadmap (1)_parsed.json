Niche Research (or general approach?)\n\nThe best way to be an insider (most of you are not):\n- Pick 5 niches you think are the best fit (pain is stronger than desire).\n- Research those industries:\n- Use **YouTube/Google** as an insider.\n- Utilize **ChatGPT**.\n- Get a clear map of the business processes and pain points.\n\n> *We don\u2019t sell AI Chatbots; we sell \u201can increase in revenue by X due to solving pain point Y.\u201d To understand these numbers, pain points, and their correlation, deep research is required.*\n\n- Build a clear map in **Figma** or **Miro** with their processes and problems along the way. Based on that, come up with solutions, specific quotes, and pitches for the calls.\n\n**Outcome:** I\u2019ll start with the Hospitality niche.\n\n----\n\n## 3. Solution Selection\n\nUnderstand which kind of solution would solve a particular problem for your **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**. Test it with real businesses.\n\n**Outcome:**\n- AI Chatbot (connected to GPT + knowledge base of the hotel).\n- Connected to the hotel's system, so it understands which rooms are available and can accept bookings.\n- This chatbot is deployed to a website + integrated to **WhatsApp/Messenger**.\n- Available via **QR codes** in rooms.\n- Answers to reviews on **Google Maps**.\n\n----\n\n# Branding &#x26; Operations Toolkit\n\n## 4. Name &#x26; Domain\n- **Name &#x26; Domain:** Namecheap or GoDaddy.\n- **Website:** bosar.agency\n1. Build it yourself.\n2. Hire a web-design agency.\n3. Use a template - Nebula Template.\n\n- **Social Media:** LinkedIn.\n- **Gmail:** bohdan@bosar.agency (not bosar@gmail.com).\n- **CRM/Calendly:** I use **Airtable** (developer hub, a lot of space for integrations).\n- **Slack/Jira.**\n\n----\n\n## Lead Generation - Inbound\n\n*Content continues...*",

Understand Your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)\n- **Niche**\n- **Title**\n- **Employee count**\n- **Industry jargon**\n\nThe more specific and relevant, the higher the conversion rate (CR).\n\n## 2. Create a Relevant Offer\nAvoid generic offers like \u201cAI automation.\u201d Instead, focus on specific solutions.\n\n### Examples:\n- \"We'll increase customer retention by X% through unique AI automations.\"\n- \"We'll cut ad spend while doubling revenue in 90 days through email retention systems.\"\n- \"We'll add X% to your AOV within 3 months or we'll pay you.\"\n\n### Tailor the offer to the ICP:\n- Example: \"We work with clothing brands to decrease abandoned carts by 20% in 60 days with our pure-commission AI system.\"\n\n## 3. Cold Email Frameworks\nEvery line in your email must have a purpose \u2013 no fluff.\n\n### Top Frameworks:\n1. Intro > Offer > Case Study > CTA\n2. Intro > Case Study > Value CTA\n3. Intro > Pain Point > Solution CTA\n4. Intro > Value CTA > P.S. Case Study\n5. Email 1: One-liner Email > Email 2: Offer > CTA\n6. Intro > CTA Offer > Case Study\n7. Intro > Question > Value CTA\n\n## 4. The 5 Main Pieces of a Cold Email\n- **Intro**: Who you are (show personalization).\n- **Offer**: What you do (\u201cpromise of the end result or we work for free\u201d).\n- **Pain Point**: Highlight challenges (focus on what they\u2019re losing, not what they can gain).\n- Example: \"Noticed a few mistakes in your welcome flow that could be costing X% conversions every month. Made you a video covering how to fix these mistakes, can I send it to you?\"\n- **Case Study**: Showcase who and how you\u2019ve helped before.\n- Example: \"Hey, we recently helped a TikTok ads agency struggling to find leads go from 0 to 20 sales calls per month in 45 days.\"\n- **CTA (Call to Action)**:\n- Hard CTA: \"Let's hop on a 15-min call...\" (rarely in the first email).\n- Soft CTA: \"Mind if I send more info?\"\n- Value CTA: \"Can I send you a video?\" (best-performing).\n\n----\n\n## Inbox Management\n*Content related to inbox management is not provided in the current text.*\n\n----\n\nThis document outlines a structured approach to crafting effective cold emails, emphasizing the importance of understanding your target audience, creating tailored offers, and utilizing proven frameworks to enhance engagement and conversion rates.",
