Let's go through a few steps to troubleshoot this:\n\n1. **Check Power Connections**: Ensure that the main power cable is securely plugged into the Control Box.\n2. **Verify Drive Power Indicator**: Look for the drive power indicator light. If it's not on, there may be an issue with the power supply.\n3. **Inspect Digital Outputs**: Make sure the drive power indicator is correctly connected to the Digital Outputs (DO4 and 0V) as per the schematic.\n\nIf the indicator light is off after checking these steps, it might be a good idea to double-check the power source or consult the manual for further troubleshooting.

Here's a quick overview of how it works:\n\n- **Collision Detection:** The manipulator can sense unexpected forces applied to the arm, helping to prevent torch misalignment.\n- **Flex-Servo Control:** Upon detecting a collision, the system quickly switches to flex-servo mode, allowing the arm to release the force and avoid damage to the torch.\n\nThis functionality enhances operational efficiency and safety, making your welding tasks smoother.

The NC (Normally Closed) pin should be connected to the control circuit that needs to be stopped in an emergency.\n- **Testing**: After wiring, test the E-stop to ensure it immediately stops all robot motion when pressed.\n\n### Enabling Device Wiring:\n- **Connect the enabling device**: This should be wired in conjunction with your start control. Ensure it\u2019s set up to allow operation only when the device is activated.\n- **Safety Check**: Always verify that the enabling device is functioning correctly before starting operations.\n\n### Important Safety Note:\n- Make sure to comply with safety standards like ISO 13850 and IEC 60204-1 when setting up your emergency stop and enabling devices.\n\nIf you need more detailed instructions or specific part numbers, feel free to ask!",

This contributes to better welding performance and efficiency.\n\nIf you want more details on how to set up or use these features, just let me know!",
